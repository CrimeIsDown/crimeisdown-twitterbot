CrimeIsDown Twitter Bot
=======================

**NOTE: This bot is currently broken due to [Twitter's recent API restrictions](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2017/announcing-more-functionality-to-improve-customer-engagements-on-twitter.html).**

This Twitter bot retweets statuses talking about a certain Chicago
Police radio zone with the livestream link, allowing anyone, even without a
scanner, to listen in. Currently running on
[@CrimeIsDown](https://twitter.com/CrimeIsDown).

For example...

1. [Original
   tweet](https://twitter.com/EricTendian/status/548250442099326977)
2. [Bot's
   retweet](https://twitter.com/CrimeIsDown/status/548250442904666114)

Made with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Twit NPM
package](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) to interact with Twitter's API.

Contributions are welcomed from anyone.
